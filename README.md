# Cursor-Drawing

## Overview
This is a simple program I put together during a short train ride. It's an old one, not the cleanest code, but it does the job.

## Functionality
Move your mouse around the panel, hold Left click to draw.

## Code
The code is a bit messy, but it works. Most of the action happens in the [Form1](https://github.com/xenos1337/Cursor-Drawing/blob/main/3D%20Cursor%20Animation/Form1.cs) class.
